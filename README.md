# 🚀 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning 🎯  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of **#DigitalSkillFair36** by **Dibimbing.id**. The goal is to build a **Machine Learning model** to classify breast cancer as **benign** or **malignant**, helping in **early detection** and improving patient outcomes.  

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Breast cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment, but traditional methods can have **high False Negative rates**, leading to undetected malignant cases. This project aims to improve **prediction accuracy** using various **Machine Learning algorithms**.  

## 💡 Solution Approach  
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**, which contains features extracted from digitized images of breast mass samples. The classification models were trained and compared using:  

✅ **Random Forest**  
✅ **Logistic Regression** *(Best performing model: 98% accuracy)*  
✅ **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  
✅ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  
To measure the performance of each model, we used:  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** *(Data Processing)*  
- **Scikit-Learn** *(Model Training & Evaluation)*  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** *(Data Visualization)*  

## 📌 Key Findings  
🔹 **Logistic Regression** outperformed other models with an accuracy of **98%**.  
🔹 **Random Forest** performed well but had slightly lower precision.  
🔹 **False Negatives were minimized**, ensuring better cancer detection.  

## 🎯 Conclusion  
Machine Learning plays a significant role in **early breast cancer detection**, assisting in **faster and more accurate diagnoses**. The **Logistic Regression model** proved to be the most **efficient and reliable** for this study.
